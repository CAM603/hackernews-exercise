# Welcome to Hackernews Unstyled

## Instructions

-   Build an application that lets the user search the Hacker News Algolia API and displays a list of results (https://hn.algolia.com/api)
-   Save the user's search terms in the Redux state (don't need to persist across sessions)
-   We don't care about design/UI (for this project)

## To start

In the project directory, you can run `npm start`

## Please consider

-   Styling was not attempted
-   Proper git flow was not used. Project was created on my local machine and then pushed to GitHub :)
